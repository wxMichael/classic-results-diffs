[!] FOUND : [FE034] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.
