CHECKING FOR MODS THAT CAN CAUSE FREQUENT CRASHES...
====================================================
[!] FOUND : [3B] NCR Renegade Armor
    - Broken outfit mesh that crashes the game in 3rd person or when NPCs wearing it are hit.
    -----
# [!] CAUTION : ANY ABOVE DETECTED MODS HAVE A MUCH HIGHER CHANCE TO CRASH YOUR GAME! #
* YOU CAN DISABLE ANY / ALL OF THEM TEMPORARILY TO CONFIRM THEY CAUSED THIS CRASH. * 

====================================================
CHECKING FOR MODS THAT CONFLICT WITH OTHER MODS...
====================================================
[!] CAUTION : Extended Weapon Systems ❌ CONFLICTS WITH : Tactical Reload
    Using both mods can frequently crash the game.
    Use only one of these mods, not both at the same time.
    -----
[!] CAUTION : Vulkan Renderer ❌ CONFLICTS WITH : Nvidia Reflex Support
    Vulkan Renderer can break GPU recognition from NV Reflex Support. This can crash the game or cause weird mod behavior.
    If you encounter Nvidia Driver crashes, CLASSIC suggests using Vulkan Render only. Otherwise, use Nvidia Reflex Support.
