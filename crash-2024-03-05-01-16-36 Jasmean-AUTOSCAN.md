CHECKING FOR MODS WITH SOLUTIONS & COMMUNITY PATCHES
====================================================
[!] FOUND : [0E] Armor And Weapons Keywords
    - If you don't rely on AWKCR, consider switching to Equipment and Crafting Overhaul
      Better Alternative: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67679?tab=files
      Patches to remove AWKCR: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40752?tab=files
    -----
[!] FOUND : [6B] Decay Better Ghouls
    - You have to install DECAY Redux patch to prevent its audio files from crashing the game.
      Patch Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/59025?tab=files
    -----
[!] FOUND : [54] Everyone's Best Friend
    - This mod needs a compatibility patch to forward changes made by the Unofficial Patch.
      Patch Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJvrnaxmui22P1X44V2VTkifjmfahtLM
      If you have Horizon installed or don't use UFO4P, this patch is not needed.
    -----
[!] FOUND : [2C] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.
