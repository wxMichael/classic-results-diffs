      Read the fixes description carefully for installation info.

[!] FOUND : [0A] Armor And Weapons Keywords
    - If you don't rely on AWKCR, consider switching to Equipment and Crafting Overhaul
      Better Alternative: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67679?tab=files
      Patches to remove AWKCR: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40752?tab=files
    -----
[!] FOUND : [FE059] Everyone's Best Friend
    - This mod needs a compatibility patch to forward changes made by the Unofficial Patch.
      Patch Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJvrnaxmui22P1X44V2VTkifjmfahtLM
      If you have Horizon installed or don't use UFO4P, this patch is not needed.
    -----
[!] FOUND : [FE02E] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.

    -----
[!] FOUND : [32] Give Me That Bottle

    -----
[!] FOUND : [F4] Start Me Up
