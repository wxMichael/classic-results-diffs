CHECKING FOR MODS WITH SOLUTIONS & COMMUNITY PATCHES
====================================================
[!] FOUND : [09] Armor And Weapons Keywords
    - If you don't rely on AWKCR, consider switching to Equipment and Crafting Overhaul
      Better Alternative: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67679?tab=files
      Patches to remove AWKCR: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40752?tab=files

[!] FOUND : [28] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.
