    - Looks Menu versions 1.6.20 & 1.6.19 can frequently break adult mod related (erection) morphs.
      If you notice AAF related problems, remove latest version of Looks Menu and switch to 1.6.18.
    -----
[!] FOUND : [08] Armor And Weapons Keywords
    - If you don't rely on AWKCR, consider switching to Equipment and Crafting Overhaul
      Better Alternative: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/67679?tab=files

[!] FOUND : [FE033] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.

[!] FOUND : [FE0A1] HUD Caps
