      If you notice AAF related problems, remove latest version of Looks Menu and switch to 1.6.18.
    -----
[!] FOUND : [09] Armor And Weapons Keywords
    - If you don't rely on AWKCR, consider switching to Equipment and Crafting Overhaul

    -----
[!] FOUND : [39] Everyone's Best Friend
    - This mod needs a compatibility patch to forward changes made by the Unofficial Patch.
      Patch Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJvrnaxmui22P1X44V2VTkifjmfahtLM

    -----
[!] FOUND : [DLL] Fallsouls Unpaused Game Menus
    - Occasionally breaks the Quests menu, can cause crashes while changing MCM settings.
      Advised Fix: Toggle PipboyMenu in FallSouls MCM settings or completely reinstall the mod.

[!] FOUND : [9F] Fallui Item Sorter (OLD)
    - This is an outdated item tagging / sorting patch that can cause crashes or conflicts in all kinds of situations.
      I strongly recommend to instead generate your own sorting patch and place it last in your load order.
      That way, you won't experience any conflicts / crashes and even modded items will be sorted.
